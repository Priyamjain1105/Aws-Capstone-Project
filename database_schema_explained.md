# 🌐 Putting it all together

Imagine it like this:

```
👤 User (student) 
    └── 📁 Portfolio (summary, skills, resume)
    └── 📝 Application -> 🏢 Job (by recruiter)

👤 User (recruiter)
    └── 🏢 Job (title, description)
```

✅ A **student user** can upload portfolios & apply to jobs.
✅ A **recruiter user** can post jobs and later maybe shortlist students.
